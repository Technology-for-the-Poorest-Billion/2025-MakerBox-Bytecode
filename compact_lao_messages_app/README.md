# Compact Lao Messages App for Arduino

This project provides a Python-based pipeline for:

Reading Unicode text (including complex scripts like Lao),
Decomposing each string into human-readable grapheme clusters,
Rasterizing each grapheme using a chosen font,
Generating C++ header files to display text on a pixel-based embedded display (e.g., Arduino).

Supports any script thanks to HarfBuzz and FreeType.

## Outputs:

1. `./arduino_code/scrolling_messages.ino` : An example of code for displaying a scrolling message on an OLED screen
2. `./arduino_code/glyph_bitmaps.h` : auto-generated header file, containing the all the needed bitmaps compressed into one large bitmap (to save space)
3. `./arduino_code/phrases_to_display.h` : auto-generated header file, containing, for each input phrase, a squential list of indexes into the overall character list

## Setup

1. Clone the Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ ...`
`cd compact_lao_messages_app`
2. Create a Virtual Environment:
`python3 -m venv .venv`
`source .venv/bin/activate`   # On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

    Required packages include:
    * Pillow
    * freetype-py
    * uharfbuzz
    * grapheme
    * tqdm

    You may also need system-level dependencies like freetype-dev.

## How to Run

1. `python3 run.py`

### What Happens:
If `input.csv` already exists, it is loaded and processed.
If `input.csv` does not exist, you will be prompted to enter phrases one at a time in the terminal.
Each phrase is broken into grapheme clusters and rasterized to 30Ã—30 black & white bitmaps.
The outputs header files, as specified above, are written into `\arduino_code`
