Do you want us to use the same screen - the HTCC AB02S OLED or the E paper module? any screen, when battery runs out it still displays (E-ink). Screen size - any. 

Code works, just missing characters -> but missing chars have tone markers and vowels above the consonants (so more complicated). 

In excel sheet, column B is full alphabet, all other columns are potential combinations. Green are done as are column B (green are most popular) Ken will highlight in yellow the most often used consonants etc. Row 25 is obsolete letter in alphabet

is the fonts.h header file something you wrote? Was there a template? built on an existing work in progress.

what is the main deliverable - is it a complete version of the font 20 file with all lao characters? (i.e 49 more characters) Yes!

messages likely to be sonething along the lines of "field is too wet, turn off water"

if we can use multiple screens - what is the part mentioned about pixel size and scaling the characters? - cannnot enlarge font so multiple files needed for different screen sizes. pixel design - binary - hex for display. worth looking at what exists in terms of scaling automatically. 

if we manage to complete the bytefont file and set up a program to display text on a screen is there anything further we can do - eg. integrating with existing speech to text software ect - 

most difficult part - vowels above and below.
