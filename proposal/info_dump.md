Do you want us to use the same screen - the HTCC AB02S OLED or the E paper module?
is the fonts.h header file something you wrote?
what is the main deliverable - is it a complete version of the font 20 file with all lao characters? (i.e 49 more characters)
if we can use multiple screens - what is the part mentioned about pixel size and scaling the characters?
which characters are on the keyboard from the excel sheet?
if we manage to complete the bytefont file and set up a program to display text on a screen is there anything further we can do - eg. integrating with existing speech to text software ect?
