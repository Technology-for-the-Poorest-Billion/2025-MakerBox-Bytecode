# Project management plan

Given the hybrid nature of our project with some of our team in Laos it is very important to be efficiently organised with effective communication. The team here in Cambridge keeps in touch constantly to track the progress of the project. We share this progress with the team in Laos as when we make it whilst receiving regular updates and information from the Laos side. Given the holistic nature of the project, we endevaour to work together as much in person and in tandem as possible.

## The people

We are working on an existing project pioneered by MakerboxLao, alongside:

### Ken Streutker 

Project lead and our main point of contact in Laos. Our primary outlet for discussing project logistics, arranging meetings and keeping fully stocked up on all information we need for the project.

### KaBuild (Bill)

Has worked on our specific task - creating the bytecode file - for 8 months. He has designed a number of the most popular symbols found in the Lao alphabet, for a specific HTCC AB02S OLED screen. Has the most comprehensive understanding of the project so will be our main technical liason. Understands written English, but struggles more with spoken English.

### Sinthala (Oui)

Head of text to speech, less directly involved in the specifics of the bytecode but one of the lead developers on the overall project and has the best English of those on the more technical arm of the project so acts as a good liason for us when discussing some of the more nuanced sides of the technical project.

## The timeline
Hardware should in by the end of this week allowing us to set up our kit for experimental testing and allow us to trial current progress with letters that have been encoded.

Concurrently, familiarising ourelves with the basis of the Lao language, giving us an important bridge between the techincality and the output so we can optimise our design direction. 

Identify the most important letters to form based on their frequency of usage in the language.

Next week:
Display strings of previously generated letters on th screen.

Generate some more letters that can be displayed at least individually on the screen.

Once we have managed to get a few of the letters displayed and generalise the process, extend this to certain accents (vowels) at a time.

Into the following week and beyond:

Extend this to the level were we can display certain set phrases (Makerbox only need to be able to display a set number of simple short phrases; add water, ground too wet etc.)

Ideally be able to extend it to every possible configuration of letters (even the redundant ones) 


## The assessment of the risks and safety

Limited risk involved with the project

When working with electronics it's always important to be aware of the risks involved and keep general safety measures in place. 
Even when evrything is wired up it is still important not to get complacent. We will make sure never to have liquids around the arduino and screen and careful how close to the edge of the table we keep our rig.

## Contengency plans
We have divided the project into a sections each with its own mini goal. Given the complexity the team in Laos have encountered, any progress in this field is invaluable to them. We firmly believe we can display some new set texts and messages that they need to display as a baseline contingency goal. Beyond this we are also confident that we can extend this to have a fully comprehensive set of letters to be deployed for the full language, not just the simpler messages required.
