# Problem description
### Aims
* The aim is to display Lao messages on an OLED or E-Ink screen 
### Current problems:
* Lao uses a combination of tone marks and vowel signs that are placed above or below a base character. 
* One computers, this complexity is handled by font shaping engines like HarfBuzz and FreeType.
* However, microcontrollers lack the memory and processing power to run these font shaping engines.
### Current solution and its challenges
* Bitmap fonts store the characters as pixel arrays and are easy to load and render making them ideal for embedded system applications.
* Unlike vector fonts, bitmapped fonts cannot respond to surrounding characters and there is no dynamic positioning of combining marks
* No resolution scaling is available without distortion of the font. Therefor to suppoer mutiple font sizes many versions of the bitmap must be created.
