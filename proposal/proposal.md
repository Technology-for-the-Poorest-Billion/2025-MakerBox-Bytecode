# Problem description
### Aims
* The aim is to display Lao messages on an OLED or E-Ink screen 
### Current problems:
* Lao uses a combination of tone marks and vowel signs that are placed above or below a base character. 
* One computers, this complexity is handled by font shaping engines like HarfBuzz and FreeType.
* However, microcontrollers lack the memory and processing power to run these font shaping engines.
### Current solution and its challenges
* Bitmap fonts store the characters as pixel arrays and are easy to load and render making them ideal for embedded system applications.
* Unlike vector fonts, bitmapped fonts cannot respond to surrounding characters and there is no dynamic positioning of combining marks. 
* No resolution scaling is available without distortion of the font. Therefore to suppoer mutiple font sizes many versions of the bitmap must be created.


# Presentation of the proposal
We propose three possible solutions:
### Continuing MakerBox's current solution
* The current solution involves pre-rendering the most common Lao syllables (combinations of base letters and marks) into individual bitmap glyphs.
* While this eliminates the need for shaping or mark positioning, this doens't scale well as supporting every valid Lao combination would require hundreds of glyphs.
* A specific keyboard would need to be designed for this solution (which would pose a problem in fitting all the combinations onto the keyboard space.)
### Rule-Based Rendering 
* A second solution would be to develop a rule based program which uses a simple set of ruled to decide where to place tone marks. Eg. If the incoming text includes a base consonant followed by a vowel, the program would detect this and then place the vowel a fixed offset above or below the consonant.
* This solution would be compatible with a standard Lao keyboard and Unicode.
* However, there may be problems with the overlapping characters due to inadequate offsets and multiple stacked marks could be a problem.
