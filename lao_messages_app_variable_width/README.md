## **Step 1: Initial Project Setup (All Users)**

These first three steps are required for **all operating systems** and both setup methods.

1.  **Open Your Terminal**
    * On Windows, we recommend opening **Git Bash** or **PowerShell**.
    * On macOS or Linux, open your standard **Terminal**.

2.  **Clone the Repository**
    Navigate to a suitable directory, then run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2025-MakerBox-Bytecode.git](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2025-MakerBox-Bytecode.git)
    ```

3.  **Navigate to the Project Folder**
    ```bash
    cd 2025-MakerBox-Bytecode/lao_messages_app_variable_width
    ```

After completing these steps, proceed to the instructions for your specific operating system below.

## **Linux & macOS Setup**

Choose one of the two methods below. The fast setup is recommended.

### Method 1: Fast Setup ‚ö°

This method uses a shell script to automate the entire setup.

1.  **Make the Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x fast_setup_arduino_LINUX.sh
    ```

2.  **Run the Setup Script:**
    ```bash
    ./fast_setup_arduino_LINUX.sh
    ```
    The script will create the environment, install packages, run the app, and open the Arduino IDE for you.

### Method 2: Manual Setup üõ†Ô∏è
<details>
<summary>Click to expand for manual Linux & macOS instructions</summary>

1.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should now show `(.venv)`.

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Python Application:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

5.  **Launch Arduino IDE:**
    * Open the Arduino IDE application.
    * Go to `File > Open...` and navigate to the project's `arduino_code` folder.
    * Open the main sketch file: `arduino_code.ino`.

6.  **Deactivate Virtual Environment:** When finished, you can exit the environment by typing:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
</details>

## **Windows Setup**

Choose one of the two methods below. The fast setup is recommended.

### Method 1: Fast Setup ‚ö°

This method uses a PowerShell script to automate the entire setup.

1.  **Run the Setup Script in PowerShell:**
    * **Note:** You may need to adjust your system's execution policy first. If the script fails, open PowerShell as an **Administrator** and run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. Press `Y` to confirm. You only need to do this once.
    * In your regular (non-admin) PowerShell terminal, run the script:
    ```powershell
    .\fast_setup_arduino_WINDOWS.ps1
    ```
    The script will handle the rest!

1.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * In **Git Bash** or **PowerShell**:
        ```bash
        source .venv/Scripts/activate
        ```
    * In **Windows Command Prompt (CMD)**:
        ```cmd
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    Your command prompt should now be prefixed with `(.venv)`.

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Python Application:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

5.  **Launch Arduino IDE:**
    * Open the Arduino IDE application.
    * Go to `File > Open...` and navigate to the project's `arduino_code` folder.
    * Open the main sketch file: `arduino_code.ino`.

6.  **Deactivate Virtual Environment:** When finished, you can exit the environment by typing:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## **Technical Details: Code Portability for Other Screens**

The Arduino code in this project is highly portable to other screens thanks to the Adafruit GFX library. The table below outlines which parts of the code are portable and what actions are required to adapt it for different display types like graphical LCDs or E-Ink screens.

| Code Section / Function | Portability to LCD | Portability to E-Ink | Required Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>` | No | No | Replace with new screen's driver header. |
| `Adafruit_SSD1306 display(...)` | No | No | Replace with new screen's object constructor. |
| `display.begin(...)` | No | No | Replace with new screen's initialization function. |
| `Wire.h` (I2C) | Dependent | Dependent | Keep if new screen is I2C, change to SPI if needed. |
| Data files (`.h`) | Yes | Yes | None. The core data is 100% portable. |
| `scrollPhrase()` | Yes | No | Works perfectly for LCD/OLED. Unsuitable for E-ink due to rapid updates. |
| `staticPhrase()` (New) | Yes | Yes | Works perfectly for LCD/OLED. This is the ideal function to use for E-ink displays. |
| Application Logic (`checkSerialInput`, etc.) | Yes | Yes | 100% portable. This logic is independent of the display hardware. |
