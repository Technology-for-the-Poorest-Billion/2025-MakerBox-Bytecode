# Project Management & Teamwork Strategy 

Effective teamwork is the foundation of successful project management. This document reflects on our approach to teamwork, highlighting aspects that proved effective and identifying areas where improvements could be made.

## Our Teamwork Strategy

We were fortunate to form a small team of three with well aligned skills and project interests. Our ability to discuss and reach decisions amicably was never in doubt, after the (ample) time we spent choosing which project to take on. Group discussion, and open communication, set the tone for the weeks to come.

Our project - as detailed in this repository - concerns the development of a system for rendering Lao characters on 'dumb' E-ink and OLED screens. The unique nature of this project - with entirely new subject matter and direct access to our end-users, the team at MakerBox Lao - resulted in a few natural phases of the project:

* **Phase 1: Group Research:** During the first phase - the first week or so prior to the project proposal - all of our time was spent working on the project collectively. This was effective as we tried to narrow down our end-user requirements, in conversation with MakerBox, and research possible problem solutions very broadly. Working together meant we could throw around ideas and iron out misconceptions.

* **Phase 2: Pursuing Alternative Avenues** Following this, we isolated the main problem, the need to generate a given character as a black and white bitmap using tools such as Pillow and Harfbuzz. Resolving this was critical to the success of our project, and so we all worked in parallel trying to develop this - in Ois√≠ns words - 'holy grail'. In hindsight, this strategy resulted in some duplicated effort, but we covered a wide space of possible solutions and achieved a breakthrough.

* **Phase 3: Individual Work** The next step was to develop the rest of the project around the 'char_to_bits' function. For this phase our strategy was to allocate each person a different part of the project to work on individually, taking care to define the interfaces between these project components. This allowed for specialisation and resulted in fast efficient work.

It has been a pleasure to work with the rest of my team on this project, we have communicated well and worked hard together. Broadly speaking our work has been more collaboratuve than individual, and this has resulted in a strong 'Esprit de Corps'. Some considerations for future work would be a having a more defined plan before each goup meeting. Having said this I think that our flexibility was generally a strength, allowing us to adapt to different parts of the project taking more (or less) time than anticipated.
